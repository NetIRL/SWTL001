# LR11xx Updater tool

This tool is a reference implementation of the mechanism to update a firmware in a LR1110 / LR1120 / LR1121 chip. It is based on the [Application Note AN1200.57](https://semtech.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/#E0000000JelG/a/2R000000Hlit/77J00f9xeOhqu8XDfHrB0G54bEJGikO58GGYT__hyis) - "LR1110: Upgrade of the Program Memory".

## Requirements

### Supported boards

This tool is developed on the ST Microeletronic [NUCLEO-L476RG development board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l476rg.html). It is a reference implementation that can be ported to another MCU.

### Touchscreen (optional)

This tool is compatible with a touchscreen (DM-TFT28-116) that can be optionnaly connected on top of the shield to get information directly - without the need to open a terminal on the computer connected to the board.

### Toolchain

This tool can be compiled with the following toolchains:

* [Keil MDK ARM](https://www2.keil.com/mdk5) - Keil project file available in `apps/<example>/MDK-ARM/`
* [GNU Arm Embedded toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm) - makefile available in `apps/<example>/makefile/`

## Getting started

### Configure

Before starting to build an example, make sure to choose the proper firmware header file being included in the [main file](application/src/main.c), ``application/src/main.c``.

The code comprises a define ``IMAGE_HEADER_FILE`` that is defined through the ``Makefile``.

If you are using the Makefile you can __either__:

* Define this by calling the make command with the proper value:

    ```shell
    make IMAGE_HEADER_FILE=lr1110_modem_1.1.9.h
    ```

* Define independantly the radio chip, the mode and the version as the make file will deduce the header to include from it:

    ```shell
    make RADIO=lr1110 RADIO_MODE=modem RADIO_VERSION=1.1.9
    ```

If you want to use the Keil project you need to change the definition of ``IMAGE_HEADER_FILE`` in the project properties

In any case you can also simply modify directly the source file adding the desired include manually.

### Build

#### Pre-compiled binaries

Pre-compiled binaries are available in [the Wiki](https://github.com/Lora-net/SWTL001/wiki/home).

#### Keil MDK ARM

This tool is delivered with a Keil project file - see `keil/lr11xx-updater-tool.uvprojx`.

To build a project:

1. Launch Keil IDE
2. Open the project file
3. Compile

#### GNU Arm embedded toolchain

This tool is built from a Makefile available in the root folder of the project.

The output files of the build process are stored in the `build` folder with firmware binary file having the same name as the project with a .bin extension.

To build a project, simply run make:

```shell
cd $LR11XX_UPDATER_TOOL_FOLDER
make
```

### Load

After a project is built, it can be loaded onto a device.

There are multiple ways to do it, among which:

* Drag and drop the binary file to the USB drive listed by our OS - usually shows up as `NODE_L476RG`.
* Load it through the Keil IDE
* A tool like [STM32 Cube Programmer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html)

### Operations

As soon as the binary is downloaded, the update process begins.

The user can get information about the update status through the following interfaces:

* LEDs: an orange LED is on during the update and a green LED indicates that the update is successful (or a red LED if something went wrong)
* COM port: if there is a terminal connected to the COM port exposed by the NUCLEO board, information can be read (bitrate set to 921600 bps)
* Touchscreen (if connected): the status is displayed on the screen
